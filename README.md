# OMCRM Deployment Guide

This repository contains a Flask-based CRM application configured for demonstration with Docker.

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Git installed

## Deployment Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/letstrythis.git
cd letstrythis
```

2. **Create required directories**

```bash
mkdir -p logs instance nginx
```

3. **Setup the environment variables**

The default environment variables are in the `.env` file. You can modify them as needed.

4. **Build and start the containers**

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start both the web application and the Nginx reverse proxy.

5. **Access the application**

The application will be available at:
- http://your-server-ip

## Folder Structure

- `logs/`: Application logs
- `instance/`: SQLite database and instance-specific files
- `nginx/`: Nginx configuration files
- `omcrm/`: Application source code

## Database

This demonstration uses SQLite for simplicity. The database file will be stored in the `instance` directory.

## API Keys

The application uses Alpha Vantage API for Forex data. The default key is included for demonstration purposes but has rate limits. For production use, obtain your own API key from [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key).

## Customization

- Edit `config.py` to change application settings
- Edit `nginx/app.conf` to customize the Nginx configuration
- Edit `Dockerfile` to modify the container setup

## Troubleshooting

- Check the application logs: `docker-compose logs web`
- Check the Nginx logs: `docker-compose logs nginx`
- Ensure all volumes are mounted correctly
- Verify the SQLite database has correct permissions
